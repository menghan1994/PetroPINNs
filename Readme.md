# Optimising Waterflooding Strategies for Enhanced Oil Recovery with Physics-Informed Neural Networks

This repository contains the code for the research work titled "Optimising Waterflooding Strategies for Enhanced Oil Recovery with Physics-Informed Neural Networks," which has been submitted to the SPE Journal.

## Overview

The code in this repository is structured to facilitate the training and analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for optimizing waterflooding strategies in oil recovery. It includes scripts for both 2D and 3D cases, as well as a script for optimizing water injection rates using a genetic algorithm.

## File Descriptions

- `Train_PINNs_2D.py`: Script for training the 2D case of the PINN model.
- `analysis_2D.py`: Used for analyzing the model's results for the 2D case.

- `Train_PINNs_3D.py`: Script for training the 3D case of the PINN model.
- `analysis_3D.py`: Used for analyzing the model's results for the 3D case.

- `optimisation.py`: Script to optimize the water injection rate using a genetic algorithm.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
3. Run the training scripts for either the 2D or 3D case as per your requirement.
4. Analyze the results using the corresponding analysis scripts.
5. For optimization, execute `optimisation.py`.
